# Tutorial: Operating-System

This project delves into core *Operating System* functionalities, showcasing how an OS efficiently manages computer resources. It demonstrates different **CPU scheduling** approaches to decide which program gets to use the processor, various **memory management** techniques to organize and allocate system memory, and mechanisms for **process synchronization** to ensure concurrent programs work together without conflicts. Furthermore, it includes **disk scheduling** algorithms to optimize how data is read from and written to storage.
